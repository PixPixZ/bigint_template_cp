# bigint_template_cp
(my) templates for dealing with big integers in C++, used in competitive programming

<hr>

### recommendations:
- v1: basic and good bigint module, comes with addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation,... fits for normal use<br>
- v2: fastest module, comes with all possible basic operations, **very recommended** for competitive programming!<br>
- v3: normal and easy to use module, comes with only addition, subtraction, and multiplication. It is considered a weak module since it doesn't support division :<<br>

<hr>
some of them aren't mine but i modified it into my coding style<br>
i left a credit note inside each template (credit the real author who wrote most of that template)

<br><br>
__feel free to use and modify if you want__<br>
im still updating new templates (not very frequent tho because i have things to study (and probably a life too))
